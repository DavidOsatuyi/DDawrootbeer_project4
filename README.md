INTRODUCTION

Objective of the Project

This report reviews the 2024 business performance of Allen & Wright Root Beer, focusing on profit trends across products, customer segments, and global markets. Our goal is simple: to understand what worked, what didn’t, and how we can do better — using data to guide smart decisions in the year ahead.

We aim to:

- Discover the products bringing in the most revenue.

- Highlight the best customer segments to focus on.

- Understand patterns in monthly and seasonal profit shifts.

- Offer down-to-earth recommendations based on the data.

UNDERSTANDING THE DATA

Data Source

The figures come directly from the company’s internal sales records — tracking products sold, profits made, and who bought what, where, and when.

DATA VISUALIZATIONS/CHARTS


Paseo was the top product, both in profit and quantity sold, while Montana had the lowest profit margins.

The Government segment was our biggest customer group, contributing over 65% of total profit, while Enterprise customers actually led to a loss of $420,788.

Top Markets

- France, Canada, and Germany led the profit table.

- Mexico lagged behind and may need closer attention.


When Did We Make the Most Money?

- December was the highest-earning month.

- Profits dipped notably in March and July, hinting at off-peak periods or possible marketing gaps.

KEY INSIGHTS

1. Paseo is gold — It’s consistent, in demand, and delivers on both price and volume.

2. Government partnerships are working — This segment is reliable and profitable.

3. End-of-year seasons bring high returns — Likely due to festive demand or strategic campaigns.

4. Enterprise segment is bleeding funds — Needs rethinking or restructuring.

5. Mexico and some products (like Carretera) underperformed — Action is needed.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Double down on Paseo and Government

Strengthen supply chains, create bundles, or explore exclusive government partnerships.

2. Fix or phase out the Enterprise segment

Dive deeper to find out why this segment is losing money — wrong targeting? Unfavorable pricing?

3. Grow where the soil is fertile

Countries like France and Canada are delivering results — consider more promotions or distributors in these regions.

4. Boost your year-end strategies

Since Q4 (October–December) brings in a third of the year’s profit, let’s make it even better with special campaigns or promotions.

5. Review struggling products

If Carretera and Montana don’t show improvement after a push, it might be time to retire or rebrand them.

CONCLUSION

This analysis shows that Allen & Wright is in a strong position — but there’s room to tighten the screws. Focus on what’s working, cut off what’s not, and keep an eye on timing and territory. With the right strategies, 2025 can be even more profitable.
